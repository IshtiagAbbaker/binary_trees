A binary tree is a hierarchical data structure composed of nodes, each containing a maximum of two children nodes, typically referred to as the left child and the right child. The topmost node is called the root. In a binary tree, each child node can have at most one parent node, forming a branching structure resembling an upside-down tree. Binary trees are widely used in computer science for tasks like organizing data efficiently, implementing search algorithms, and representing hierarchical relationships. Their simple yet versatile structure makes them fundamental in various applications, from database systems to algorithm design.
